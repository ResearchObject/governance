## Constitution

Following RO-Crate community calls there was wide agreement to adopt the GitHub [Minimum Viable Governance](https://github.com/github/MVG) model for RO-Crate. A repository <https://github.com/ResearchObject/governance> was established, with some modifications to the [Charter](https://github.com/ResearchObject/governance/blob/main/org-docs/CHARTER.md). 

Initial constitutional steering committee (Peter, Stian, Carole) was formed in the [RO-Crate community call #102 2025-01-09](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vg805CJ4QXY6CCBNR-8ETgkbOCAMqSKJPCKOTNxrIbk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.knqxqvxkve72), with an aim to immediately review and approve new steering committee_ members.

## Growing the steering committee

The [RO-Crate community call 2025-01-23](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vg805CJ4QXY6CCBNR-8ETgkbOCAMqSKJPCKOTNxrIbk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.o40gowbobhlm) agreed to send an email to invite existing contributors (including advocacy etc), and to approve a maximum number of 12 Steering committee members.

Stian Soiland-Reyes sent the email _Invitation to RO-Crate steering committee_ on 2025-02-11 to `ro-crate@elixir-europe.org` inviting a register of interest to join the RO-Crate Steering Committee.

## New steering committee members

The Initial Committee had planned to meet 2025-02-19, but struggled schedule in February, and instead met by email.

On 2025-03-13, following an internal Google Docs process, the committee approved, with unanimous or â…” majority, new members: [Marc Portier](https://github.com/ResearchObject/governance/pull/10), [Mike Lynch](https://github.com/ResearchObject/governance/pull/8), [Daniel Garijo](https://github.com/ResearchObject/governance/pull/5), [Raul Palma](https://github.com/ResearchObject/governance/pull/9), [Eli Chadwick](https://github.com/ResearchObject/governance/pull/4), [Rudolf Witner](https://github.com/ResearchObject/governance/pull/6), [Abigail Miller](https://github.com/ResearchObject/governance/pull/11)

The new members were added on  2025-03-13 by Peter Sefton https://github.com/ResearchObject/governance/blob/main/org-docs/STEERING-COMMITTEE.md 

One of the applicants were [encouraged](https://github.com/ResearchObject/governance/pull/7) to apply at a later stage after familiarising themselves further with the RO-Crate community. 

The initial steering committee had also voted for accepting [Josh Moore](https://github.com/ResearchObject/governance/pull/12), but unanimous agreement was not reached before the committee had already been expanded (see Agenda 4b).

## Next meeting, release candidate

It was agreed in separate emails to schedule the next steering committee meeting so that RO-Crate 1.2 release could be voted on with at least a week's notice, initially planned for 2025-04-24.
