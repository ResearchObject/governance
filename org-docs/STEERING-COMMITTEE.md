# Steering Committee

This document lists the members of the Organization's Steering Committee. Voting members may be added once approved by the Steering Committee as described in the [charter](./CHARTER.md). By adding your name to this list you are agreeing to abide by all Organization polices, including the [charter](./CHARTER.md) and the [code of conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).




# Meetings

Meetings will take place at selected instances of the RO-Crate Community call, with participating open to anyone, but with voting restricted to committee members. If sensitive matters arise special meetings may be called.

A combined agenda / minutes document in Google Docs will be used to run meetings, and a copy of the minutes will be added to this github repository after each meeting by the Chair.

Matters for voting must be noted one week prior to a meeting so that Steering Committee members may vote if they are not able to be present. Voting will be via Github issues, the exact mechanism to be determined.

# Steering Committee 

This document lists the members of the Organization's Steering Committee which shall be limited to a maximum of twelve members.

Voting members may be added once approved by the Steering Committee as described in the [charter](./CHARTER.md). By requesting to be added to this list by the chair(s) you are agreeing to abide by all Organization polices, including the [charter](./CHARTER.md), the [code of conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). 

Members are appointed to the steering committee as individuals, not as representatives of their organization. Affiliations are (optionally) listed here in line with scholarly practice, with no implication that the organization is represented by the steering committee member.

NOTE: 2025-01-02 The three people listed below form an initial Steering Committee. The committee invites RO-Crate community members who contributed during 2024  to apply with a pull request adding their name to the list below. The committee will vote to approve applications (each of which will require unanimous approval) in early February, to constitute a Steering Committee after which the new committee will appoint a chair, and consider applications from others to join the group as part of its ongoing business.
