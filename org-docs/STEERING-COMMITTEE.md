# Steering Committee 

This document lists the members of the Organization's Steering Committee.

Voting members may be added once approved by the Steering Committee as described in the [charter](./CHARTER.md). By requesting to be added to this list by the chair(s) you are agreeing to abide by all Organization polices, including the [charter](./CHARTER.md), the [code of conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). 

Members are appointed to the steering committee as individuals, not as representatives of their organization. Affiliations are (optionally) listed here in line with scholarly practice, with no implication that the organization is represented by the steering committee member.

NOTE: 2025-01-02 The three names listed below form an initial steering committee. The committee invites RO-Crate community members who contributed to the development of RO-Crate v1.2 during 2024 (by attending at least five meetings, or by contributing to github activity) to apply with a pull request adding their name. The committee will vote to approve applications (which will require consensus) in early February after which the new committee will be asked to appoint a chair.
