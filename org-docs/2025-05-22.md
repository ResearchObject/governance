**Decision**: The agenda and temporary notes to be made in Google Doc before/during the meeting, with the secretary writing up minutes for approval in the following committee and inclusion in the [governance repository](https://github.com/ResearchObject/governance).

## Review of charter – Peter Sefton

The [charter](CHARTER.md), modified from the GitHub [Minimum Viable Governance](https://github.com/github/MVG), was presented by Peter Sefton and reviewed by the committee. 

As a summary, the main modus operandus is consensus-based, where the committee tries to avoid having to vote, except on constitutional matters. If there is a vote it is simple majority (½), except on membership (¾). 

**Decision**: Changes to governance repository <https://github.com/ResearchObject/governance> must be backed by a steering committee vote, and tracked in a Pull Request. (consensus) -- _Added to section 7 of charter_.


## Steering committee membership review

Josh Moore was elected new committee member (7 votes). Josh represent BioImaging community and the [OME](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/) (Open Microscopy Environment) community, as well as [Zarr](https://zarr.dev/); both looking at adapting RO-Crate.

## Vote on RO-Crate release

Following earlier announced review, RO-Crate specification 1.2.0 RC1 was approved (7 votes for, 1 abstain, 2 absent) ([issue #14](https://github.com/ResearchObject/governance/issues/14))

**Action**: Stian to complete the release of RO-Crate 1.2. 

A [release upgrade guide](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/whats-changed-in-1-2)  was being prepared by Eli Chadwick,

The steering committee noted that the expanded 1.2 specification have unfortunately became harder to navigate, and next version 2 needs to focus on editorial cleaning up, simplifying for the purpose of implementation and validation. A modular approach should be sought, with feature-full examples or benchmark suite or RO-Crates for programmatically measuring feature completeness.



## RO-Crate engagement strategy

The committee agreed to form a subteam to review RO-Crate engagement strategy. 

* **Action**: Carole to schedule RO-Crate Engagement Strategy meeting with Josh, Abigail, Eli.
